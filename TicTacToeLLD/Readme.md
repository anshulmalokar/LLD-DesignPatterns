- LLD for TicTacToe
    - Now when we visualize a tic-tac-toe game what all things come to our mind
        - 2 Players (can be extended to n players)
        - The Sign I want to choose can be anything
        - Board for playing the game
    - These are only the classes we'll be needing for designing the complete game
        - Person
            - has Type
        - Board
            - is a 2D array of type Sign
        - Type
            - The string type we want to take.
        - GameManager
            - has a relation on Person class.
            - has a relaton on the Board class.
            - This class will be responsible to start the game and complete the game
            - This is the gamemaster which will guide the persons palying the game
                - To make a move.
                - Tell this is a valid move or not.
                - Tell if we have a winner or the game is over.
