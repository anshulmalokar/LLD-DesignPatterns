- Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
 - Examples
    - Design ATM System
    - Design Vending Machine
    - Desing Logger System.
    - Authentication Handler
- Suppose we have an ATM machine
    - Now in the machine tere are some 2000,500,100 etc notes.
    - So there would be a handler of 2000 ruppee not similarly there would be handlers for different notes.
    - Now as a client we pass a request for 200 ruppee note
        - This will first get parsed from the 2000 ruppee note handler
        - Then by the 500 ruppee handler.
    - So whenever there would be someone capable of handeling our request properly he will respond us back.
- Desing
    - One abstract handler class
        - Handlers which would extend this abstract base handler class.
    - Client class
